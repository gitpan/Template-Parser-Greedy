Template-Parser-Greedy version 1.00
===================================

This module allows templates to be optimized for readability, while at the same time enhancing control
over the spacing of the generated output. It does this by providing two new options, CHOMP_GREEDY and
CHOMP_COALESCE, and their corresponding directive modifiers, ~ and ^.

In addition, a new modifier, =, for the old CHOMP_COLLAPSE option has been added.
